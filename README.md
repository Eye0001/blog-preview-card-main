## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use @font-face to download fonts right into your project.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Figtree';
    src: url(assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf)
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue development with flexbox to design my projects.
